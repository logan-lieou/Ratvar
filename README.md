This is a bitboard based chess engine, created in C++

I made this because the web was super turbo ultra aids and I wanted to do something more interesting and fun so I decided to write a chess engine.

To find out more about writing a chess engine you can check out the chess programming wiki, yes there's an entire wiki for chess programming: https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page .


## Additional Notes 🗒️

This is using the [meson build system](https://mesonbuild.com/) so if you want to compile the code for yourself you'll have to use meson, I was thinking about using
CMake or Basel but I decided to use meson because it's the easiest to work with for me.

The project also uses [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for testing.

Don't expect this to be done anytime soon lmao.

Okay we're currently going to migrate this to using CMake.
