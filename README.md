This is a bitboard based chess engine, created in C++

I made this because the web was super turbo ultra aids and I wanted to do something more interesting and fun so I decided to write a chess engine.


To find out more about writing a chess engine you can check out the chess programming wiki, yes there's an entire wiki for chess programming: https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page .
