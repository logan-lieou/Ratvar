This is a bitboard based chess engine, created in C++

I made this because the web was super turbo ultra aids and I wanted to do something more interesting and fun so I decided to write a chess engine.

To find out more about writing a chess engine you can check out the chess programming wiki, yes there's an entire wiki for chess programming: https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page .


## Additional Notes 🗒️
Project will most likely move to using Julia in the near future.

The project also uses [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for testing.

Don't expect this to be done anytime soon lmao.

Okay we're currently going to migrate this to using CMake.
